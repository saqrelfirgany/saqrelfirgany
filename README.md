<summary><b>🏗️ Architecture Implementation</b></summary>

<br/>

**Clean Architecture Layers:**
```
📱 Presentation Layer (UI)
   ├── Screens/Pages
   ├── Widgets
   └── BLoC/Cubit (State Management)

💼 Domain Layer (Business Logic)
   ├── Entities
   ├── Use Cases
   └── Repository Interfaces

🗄️ Data Layer (Data Sources)
   ├── Models
   ├── Repository Implementations
   ├── Data Sources (Remote/Local)
   └── Mappers
```

**Benefits Delivered:**
- ✅ 100% testable code
- ✅ Easy maintenance & scalability
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Reusable business logic
- ✅ Framework independence

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔄 State Management Expertise</b></summary>

<br/>

**BLoC Pattern (Primary Expertise):**
- Event-driven architecture
- Reactive programming with Streams
- Separation of business logic from UI
- Easy testing and mocking
- Predictable state transitions

**Other State Management Solutions:**
